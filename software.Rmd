## Reproducible analysis pipelines in R

- [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets), dynamic function-oriented Make-like workflows for R. Long-term successor to [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake).
- [`tarchetypes`](https://github.com/ropensci/tarchetypes), general-use archetypes for targets and pipelines, including [parameterized R Markdown at scale](https://docs.ropensci.org/tarchetypes/reference/tar_render_rep.html).
- [`stantargets`](https://github.com/ropensci/stantargets), Reproducible Bayesian data analysis pipelines with [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) and [`cmdstanr`](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr). 
- [`jagstargets`](https://github.com/ropensci/stantargets), Reproducible Bayesian data analysis pipelines with [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) and [`R2jags`](https://github.com/suyusung/R2jags).
- [`gittargets`](https://github.com/ropensci/gittargets), local data version control for the [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) R package.

## Prior work on reproducible analysis pipelines

- [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) an R-focused pipeline toolkit for data analysis projects. Featured in the [rOpenSci blog](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/02/06/drake/) and [R Podcast Episode 22](https://r-podcast.org/episode/022-diving-in-to-drake-with-will-landau/).
- [`remakeGenerator`](https://www.github.com/wlandau/remakeGenerator) Generate large [`remake`](https://github.com/richfitz/remake)-style workflows.
- [`parallelRemake`](https://www.github.com/wlandau/parallelRemake) Parallel computing support for [`remake`](https://github.com/richfitz/remake).

## R packages with utilities and infrastructure

- [`proffer`](https://github.com/r-prof/proffer) A [`pprof`](https://github.com/google/pprof)-based profiler for R code.
- [`txtq`](https://github.com/wlandau/txtq) A small message queue for parallel processes.
- [`downsize`](https://github.com/wlandau/downsize) Ease the transition between testing and deploying data analysis workflows.

## Dissertation research

- [fbseq](https://github.com/wlandau/fbseq) Fully-Bayesian GPU-accelerated analysis of RNA-seq data ([arXiv preprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06659)).
- [fbseqCUDA](https://github.com/wlandau/fbseqCUDA) CUDA GPU support for [fbseq](https://github.com/wlandau/fbseq).
- [fbseqOpenMP](https://github.com/wlandau/fbseqOpenMP) OpenMP support for [fbseq](https://github.com/wlandau/fbseq).
