## Background

I love to create and maintain open-source software. It is a joy to solve problems with code, release solutions for everyone, and keep packages working so problems stay solved. Users send feedback on a regular basis, and I value and grow from it all. I want to keep developing and engineering for as long as possible.

## Problem

I now face an overwhelming volume of questions and requests about the projects I maintain. Requests come at all times of day on all days of the week, and each response is a context switch. The high throughput wears me down.

## Solution

Late last month, I created digital boundaries to protect my mental health and productivity. My GitHub notifications, social media, and package maintainer identity now use a special email account that I only check on certain days. The benefits were immediate, and the changes are here to stay.

## What this means for users

I send most of my responses during the middle part of the week, usually Wednesdays. I am slower than in previous years, but I still care about fixing issues and helping users.

## How you can help

If you use [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets), [`crew`](https://github.com/wlandau/crew), or any of my other packages, I would be grateful for help answering GitHub issues and discussions, especially at <https://github.com/ropensci/targets/discussions>. And if you are posting a request yourself, please respect the communication and reproducibility guidelines that I describe at <https://books.ropensci.org/targets/help.html>.
