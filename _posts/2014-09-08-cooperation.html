<h2>Cooperation on shared Linux servers</h2>

<p>If you're about to run computationally intensive jobs on a public or
departmental server 
(such as one of the impact servers at Iowa State), please help share 
the resources. Here are some favors you can do.</p>

<h3>1. Kill old processes you don't need.</h3>

<p>I recommend "top". I can look up my own processes with</p>
<pre></code>$ top -u landau
</code></pre>

<p>and I get a table of processes.</p>

<pre><code>  
PID   USER   PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR  S  %CPU   %MEM TIME+    COMMAND
19522 landau 39  19  128g  65m  24m  R  100.4  0.1  85:46.54 R
20255 landau 20  0   26328 1732 1068 R  0.7    0.0  0:00.03  top
19516 landau 39  19  103m  1320 1128 S  0.0    0.0  0:00.00  sh
20015 landau 20  0   100m  2036 1076 S  0.0    0.0  0:00.09  sshd
20016 landau 20  0   117m  3324 1636 S  0.0    0.0  0:00.12  bash
</code></pre>

<p>From looking at the %CPU column, I see that my R process 
 is the most expensive (see the COMMAND column) and has been running
 for a long time (TIME+). If I don't need this process anymore 
 or if I need to restart my workflow, I should kill it. I</p>

<ol>
<li>Type "k" within top.</li>
<li>Type the PID (process ID) of the process to kill (19522 in this case).</li>
<li>Press enter.</li>
</ol>

<h3>2. Ballpark the number of free cores.</h3>

<p>Within top, press "1" to get the following table.</p>

<p>There are 24 cores, and I can see how they spend their time.</p>

<pre><code> 
us: user cpu time (or) % CPU time spent in user space
sy: system cpu time (or) % CPU time spent in kernel space
ni: user nice cpu time (or) % CPU time spent on low priority processes
id: idle cpu time (or) % CPU time spent idle
wa: io wait cpu time (or) % CPU time spent in wait (on disk)
hi: hardware irq (or) % CPU time spent handling hardware interrupts
si: software irq (or) % CPU time spent handling software interrupts
st: steal time, % CPU time in involuntary wait by virtual cpu ...
</code></pre>

<p>Only 8 cores have more than 80%id (time spent idling), 
so spawning more than 8 expensive concurrent processes may slow down 
or even crash the server. Plus, you never know how many other people
will need to run things.</p>

<h3>3. Be nice.</h3>

<p>The Linux tool "nice" modifies the scheduling priority of your job so that
 more urgent jobs can work around it. Setting a high niceness level slows down 
 your work in the presence of more urgent jobs, but it helps the server schedule 
 its workflow and makes you a good citizen. Niceness levels range from 0 to 19, 
 and the higher the level, the nicer you are. I can submit an R job with a 
 niceness level of 19 with</p>

<pre><code> 
$ nohup nice -19 R CMD BATCH job.R &
</code></pre>

<p>(I included the ampersand at the end and nohup at the beginning to run the job 
in the background and keep it running after I log out.) To verify my job's niceness, 
I can run top and look at the NI column of the default table.</p>
